## 2. Information We Collect

### a. Health & Fitness Data (via Apple HealthKit)
With your explicit permission, The Daily Steps accesses the following data from Apple HealthKit:

- Step count data (read access only)

This data is used solely to display your daily step counts, help you set a personalized step goal, and track your weekly progress. We do not access any other HealthKit data types.

### b. Data You Provide Directly
- Step goal preferences you set within the App
- Any preferences or settings you configure

### c. iCloud Data
If you are signed into iCloud, the App uses iCloud (via CloudKit) to sync your step goals and weekly progress data across your Apple devices. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account and is subject to Apple's iCloud Privacy Policy.

### d. Automatically Collected Data
- Device type and operating system version (for compatibility and crash diagnostics)
- App crash logs and performance data

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information collected for the following purposes:

- To display your current and historical step count data within the App
- To help you set and track a personalized daily step goal
- To calculate and display your weekly step progress
- To sync your goals and progress across your devices via iCloud
- To diagnose technical issues and improve App performance

---

## 4. HealthKit Data — Special Restrictions

The Daily Steps accesses Apple HealthKit data and is subject to strict rules governing its use. We are committed to the following:

- HealthKit data is used **only** to provide health and fitness features within the App
- We do **not** use HealthKit data for advertising, marketing, or any purpose unrelated to health and fitness
- We do **not** sell HealthKit data to any third party
- We do **not** share HealthKit data with third parties except as strictly necessary to operate the App (e.g., iCloud sync via Apple's CloudKit) or as required by law

These restrictions are required by Apple and are a core commitment of The Daily Steps.

## 5. iCloud and Data Storage

### On-Device Storage
Your step data, goals, and progress are stored locally on your device using Core Data. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any servers operated by us.

### iCloud Sync
If you have iCloud enabled, your step goal and progress data may be synced to your iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit framework. This means:

- Your data is stored in your personal iCloud account, not on our servers
- Apple manages the security and storage of this data according to their privacy policy at [apple.com/legal/privacy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy)
- You can disable iCloud sync at any time in **Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud**

### Data Deletion
Deleting the App from your device will remove all locally stored Core Data. To remove iCloud data, you can manage or delete it through your iCloud settings. Any data stored in iCloud after app deletion is subject to Apple's retention policies.

---

## 6. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share information only in the following limited circumstances:

- **Apple / iCloud (CloudKit):** To sync your data across your devices, if iCloud is enabled
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law, court order, or governmental authority
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred to a successor entity, who will be bound by this Privacy Policy

We do not share your data with advertisers, analytics firms, or other third parties.

---

## 7. Your Rights and Choices

### HealthKit Permissions
You can grant or revoke the App's access to HealthKit data at any time via **Settings > Privacy & Security > Health > The Daily Steps**.

### iCloud Sync
You can enable or disable iCloud sync for The Daily Steps at any time through your device's iCloud settings.

### Data Deletion
You may delete all App data by uninstalling The Daily Steps. For iCloud data, navigate to **Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Manage Account Storage** to manage or delete App data stored in iCloud.

### GDPR Rights (EU/UK Users)
If you are located in the European Union or United Kingdom, you have the right to access, correct, delete, and export your personal data, as well as to object to or restrict processing. Since we do not operate servers holding your data (it resides on your device and in your iCloud account), most of these rights can be exercised directly on your device. For any additional requests, contact us at the email below.

### California Residents (CCPA/CPRA)
We do not sell or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. California residents have the right to know what personal information is collected and to request deletion. To exercise these rights, contact us using the information in Section 12.

## 8. Children's Privacy

The Daily Steps is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.

---

## 9. Data Security

We take reasonable precautions to protect your data. Since your data is stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account:

- Local data is protected by your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)
- iCloud data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple

We recommend using a strong device passcode and keeping your iOS software up to date. While we strive to use appropriate security measures, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 10. Third-Party Services

The Daily Steps uses the following Apple-provided frameworks and services:

- **Apple HealthKit** — for reading step count data
- **Apple Core Data** — for local on-device storage
- **Apple CloudKit / iCloud** — for cross-device data sync

These services are operated by Apple Inc. and are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy, available at [apple.com/legal/privacy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy). We do not integrate any third-party advertising SDKs, social media plugins, or analytics platforms.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If changes are material, we will notify you via an in-app notice or other appropriate means.
